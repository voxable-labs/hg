module Hg
  # An Hg controller defines a number of handler functions for actions. These
  # are analogous to the concept of "controller actions" in Rails.
  #
  # ## Handlers
  #
  # Handler methods have access to the following objects:
  #
  # * `request`: The request passed along by the `Router`.
  # * `params`: The parameters passed along for this action by the `Router`.
  # * `user`: The user that sent the request.
  #
  # ## Filters
  #
  # You have access to [all of the same filters you're used to](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#filters)
  # from ActionController. They can either be accessed in their normal form, or with
  # `handler` in place of `action` in the method name. If the filter chain should
  # be halted, you must call the `halt` method.
  #
  #   class BotController < Hg::Controller
  #     before_handler :require_login
  #
  #     private
  #
  #       def require_login
  #         unless user.logged_in?
  #           respond 'You must be logged in to access this.'
  #           respond_with OrderBot::Chunks::Login and halt
  #         end
  #       end
  #  end
