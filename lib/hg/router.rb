module Hg
  # The router is responsible for routing an incoming action to the appropriate
  # controller:
  #
  #   router.handle({
  #     action: 'orderPizza',
  #     parameters: {
  #       size: 'large',
  #       toppings: ['pepperoni', 'sausage']
  #     }
  #   })
  #
  # The `handle` method expects a `request` object consisting of, at least,
  # `action` and `parameters` keys. Postbacks and raw messages sent through an NLU
  # should use the same set of action and parameter names, so that `request` objects
  # will look the same either way by the time they reach the router.
  #
  # ## Creating a router
  #
  # Add a router to your bot by subclassing `Hg::Router`:
  #
  #   class PizzaBotRouter < Hg::Router; end
  #
  # ### Adding routes
  #
  # You can add a route for an action with the `action` method:
  #
  #   class PizzaBotRouter < Hg::Router
  #     action 'orderPizza', controller: PizzaOrdersController, with: :create
  #   end
  #
  #  Here, we're specifying that the `orderPizza` action should map to the
  # `PizzaOrdersController`'s `create` handler method.
  #
  #  Note that it's probably a good idea to store your action names as constants.
  #
  # ## The route map
  #
  # The routes map is a hash with action names as keys, pointing at
  # nested hash values with the following structure:
  #
  #   {
  #     controller: PizzaOrderController,
  #     handler: :create
  #   }
  #
  # ## Routing
  #
  # The router will map an inbound `request` to the appropriate handler method.
  # `request` objects take the following form:
  #
  #  request = {
  #     action: 'orderPizza',
  #     parameters: {
  #       size: 'large',
  #       toppings: ['pepperoni', 'sausage']
  #     }
  #  }
  #
  # Passing a `request` to `handle` directly off the bot's router class will
  # call the action's matching handler method on its controller class:
  #
  #   PizzaBotRouter.handle(request) # => PizzaOrderController.call(:create)
  class Router
    # Error thrown when an action isn't recognized by the router.
    class ActionNotRegisteredError < StandardError
      def initialize(action)
        super("No route registered for action #{action}")
      end
